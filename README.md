# NYC Taxi Machine Learning Project

## Introduction
This project uses the NYC Taxi Trip Duration dataset to demonstrate various machine learning techniques for optimizing ride-sharing services, including capacity planning, driver matching, dynamic pricing, and ETA prediction.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed NYC Taxi dataset to extract meaningful features.
- Capacity Planning: Implemented an LSTM model to forecast demand and optimize driver availability.
- Driver Matching: Created a mock collaborative filtering system for driver-passenger matching.
- Dynamic Pricing: Developed a regression model to dynamically adjust fare prices based on demand-supply conditions.
- Incentive Strategy: Analyzed trip data to devise incentive strategies for drivers.
- ETA Prediction: Built a neural network model to accurately predict the estimated time of arrival (ETA).

## Impact
- Capacity Planning: Improved demand forecasting accuracy and optimized driver availability.
- Driver Matching: Enhanced driver-passenger matching efficiency.
- Dynamic Pricing: Adjusted fare prices dynamically, maximizing revenue during peak hours.
- Incentive Strategy: Increased driver retention and service reliability through effective incentives.
- ETA Prediction: Achieved high accuracy in ETA prediction, improving customer satisfaction.
